# PERSONAL ASSISTANT

If you download this file into your device, then I promise you won't regret it. This will be your personal favorite assistant. There are `SIRI, GOOGLE ASSISTANT` out there, but why not to try something new. 

## Here are some instructions you need to follow to use this assistant.

1. After opening this file, you need to wake up your personal assistant by saying anything attached with `wake up`. You can say `wake up bro` or `can you wake up`. It can be anything, but make sure it has the key word `wake up`.

2. After waking up your personal assistant, you can give any instructions to it, which I will be discussing below. But if you want to stop your personal assistant taking your instructions when you speak, then you can say anything attached with `you can sleep` or `sleep now`. For example: it can be `Hey bro, thanks for your help. you can sleep` or `buddy, sleep now` or anything that comes to your head.

3. May be you don't have anything to ask to your personal assistant. Now you want to close your program. You can say anything attached with `goodbye`. It can be `goodbye buddy` or anything. 

`You don't have to attach anything with the main keyword if you don't want to.`

`One more thing: when you are giving instructions to your personal assistant, then it will show "Listening..." on the screen. Additionally, if it is processing your instructions it will show "Recognizing..." on the screen; however, it it doesn't understant what you are trying to ask your personal assistant to do, then ir will say "I did not get that. Can you please say that again..."`


## There are differnt features you can get after starting to use this personal assistant in your device.

`With different features, I will be highlighting the exact keyword you have to tell to your personal assistant if you need to perform certain operations. You can attach other things while giving instructions to your assistant if you want, but it is not mandatory.`

## To send email to someone

But for this you have to go to line 99-104 in your bro.py file. Then you have to put the real email of the person you want to email when you want. I have set a dummy email over there. For example: `person1@gmail.com`

You can set four favorite person's email that you use often. 

You have to remember whose email is in `email to danny` or `email to sandy` or `email to andy` or `email to john`, so it won't be difficult for you to come to the the bro.py file and look at the code again.

After that, you have to go to line number 91 and 92 and set your real email and password.
MOreover, You have to 'enable the less secure apps' feature in your Gmail account. For that you just have to go to [Enable the less secure apps](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps?pli=1&rapt=AEjHL4NUHRxhYXLq9J2esOBwKxyR2crfke7igqnhBJcww4Z18eO2pKeXFLgAtjJo8_Ab0XvppVxGG9ldW_K5hD9Wud-J3GpUoQ), and make allow less secure apps `on`. If you don't then email feature might not work properly.
